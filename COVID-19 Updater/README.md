# Simple COVID-19 Update Cases in India

_We will create a simple program which will update the covid-19 cases within given interval_

**To Do so we have to import some modules i.e. `requests` and `win10toast`**

* We have to use an api that has updated data of current covid-19 state. [Link for api](http://covid19-india-adhikansh.herokuapp.com/summary)
* We have to import [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) to get the data from the api
* We have to import [win10toast](https://pypi.org/project/win10toast/) to get the toast notification on windows 10
* We will create a loop for getting the notification updates with given interval
* Call the function to run.
