# Here we are using Optical Character Recognition

_OCR is used to convert the image into text_

##What is OCR ?

****

**Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.**

_To do OCR in Python we have to use a module `pytesseract`._ [for more info](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)

* We have to download the exe file for tesseract from [tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
* We have to install a pytesseract package in python as well.
`pip install pytesseract`. [more](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)
* We also have to install `PIL` i.e. **Python Image Library** to read the image. [more](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow-PIL/)
`pip install pillow-PIL`
* The program will read the image and convert it to the text.
